### Use library:
1. [Awesome-font v4.7.0](https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/)

It's a great icon-based font to use quickly.

2. [normalize.css v8.0.1](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)

Normalize.css makes browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards. It precisely targets only the styles that need normalizing.
