### JavaScript practice

* A Static Blog Page in React.js
    * 沒有規定的外觀樣式，可以從網路上選以一個你喜歡樣本，以它為模型，用 React.js 刻一個靜態(i.e. 沒有互動功能)的網頁

### Practice Homework -- Practice03 -- 

* 作業內容：完成並且改進 Image Viewer
    * Just a static page that is composed of title, menu, sections, articles or photos, etc.
    * MUST use **React** to make it component-based so that you can add more interactions later!
    * You don't need to implement "edit", "post", "add/delete", "search", or any kind of interactions.
* Practice submission deadline: 9pm, Sunday, 03/24
    * Review deadline: 9pm, Tuesday, 03/26
* 作業注意事項：
    * Create a directory "Practice03" under "WebProg2019"
    * Create own and review directories under Practice03
    * The file names under "Practice03" can be arbitrary. However, you must use "create-react-app" to create this project. Make sure TA can run your app with "npm start" script.
    * 這次作業的重點是練習且學會寫基本的 (stateless) React.js. 關於外觀，歡迎使用你選用的樣版的 CSS file, 當然，你想要自己刻也是可以啦！
